<h1>Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to predict the diagnosis (malignant or benign) based on these features.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://github.com/Vedu36/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-SVM/blob/main/Breast_Cancer.csv].

<h2>Installation</h2>

To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Vedu36/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-SVM.git
Install the required dependencies usage

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Run the breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb notebook to execute the code.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.
